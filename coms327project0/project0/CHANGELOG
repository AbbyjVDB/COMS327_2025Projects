When I first started, I was unable to get this code to work for me
and I was having trouble figuring out how to place the words diagonally
After some research and another lecture, I was able to understand how to 
place words diagonally and how to utalize pointers.
I fixed the canPlaceWord by keeping the function signatures consistent with 
the 2D array. I then removed any code that attempted to change the pointer type.
Then I ensured all functions (canPlaceWord, placeWord, tryPlaceWord) use the same array type.
